The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

  - Identify the kernel version
   - Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
  - Run the exploit 
  - Can transfer the exploit code from your machine to the target system using the ``python3 -m http.server`` Python module and ``wget`` respectively.
